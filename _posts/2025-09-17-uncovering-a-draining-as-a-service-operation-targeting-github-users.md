# Introduction
A crypto drainer (aka. drainer) is a tool used for phishing in the Web3 ecosystem [1]. Drainers are typically operated to masquerade as legitimate Web3 projects, enticing potential victims into connecting their crypto wallet(s) to the phishing website and approving any transactions proposed [2]. This process enables the drainer's operator(s) to gain unauthorized access to the funds inside of the victim's wallet, said funds are typically stolen instantly if the draining process is successful.
